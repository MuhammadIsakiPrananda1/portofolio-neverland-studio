## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** — TOTP-based 2FA via Google Authenticator / Authy:
  - Setup flow: QR code scan → 6-digit verification → recovery codes generation
  - 8 single-use recovery codes (format `XXXXX-XXXXX`), stored encrypted
  - Disable flow requires current TOTP code or recovery code
  - Login challenge: if 2FA enabled, login returns temp token → user enters code → gets real auth token (5-min expiry)
  - Persistent per-account (survives sessions), disabled only by explicit user action
- **Active Sessions (real-time)** — Live session management in Settings:
  - Detects IP address, geolocation (city/region/country via ip-api.com), browser, OS, device type
  - Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds when panel is open
  - Current session highlighted with green animated dot
  - Per-session "Revoke" button + "Revoke All Other Sessions"
  - Cloudflare Tunnel aware: reads `CF-Connecting-IP` header for real IP
- **Full Auth System** (without Supabase):
  - Email/password register & login via Laravel Sanctum
  - Google OAuth login (TOTP 2FA compatible)
  - GitHub OAuth login
  - JWT token stored in localStorage, used across all API calls
  - Post-login redirects to homepage (not dashboard)
- **Google & GitHub OAuth** properly configured for HTTPS + Cloudflare Tunnel
- **Laravel backend** running at `https://portofolio.neverlandstudio.my.id/api/v1`
- **Sanctum token metadata**: IP address, User-Agent, geolocation saved on every login/register/OAuth

### Changed
- `Settings.tsx` Two-Factor toggle now connects to real backend API (not localStorage mock)
- `Settings.tsx` Active Sessions replaced mock data with real API + polling
- `AuthModal.tsx` login flow handles `two_factor_required` response → shows 2FA challenge view
- Login no longer deletes previous tokens → supports multi-device sessions
- `apiFetch` utility always sends `Accept: application/json` to prevent SPA HTML response

### Removed
- Supabase dependency completely removed from frontend and backend
- Mock session data in Settings.tsx

### Fixed
- `apiFetch` missing `Accept: application/json` header causing HTML response parsed as JSON
- `API_BASE` URL now correctly appends `/api/v1` using `VITE_API_VERSION` env var
- ModSecurity false-positive blocking password fields (SQLi rules) and OAuth `scope` param (LFI rules)
- Apache + Cloudflare Tunnel HTTPS conflict resolved with `trustProxies('*')` in Laravel bootstrap
- Laravel `env()` returning null with config cache → migrated to `config('services.*')`
- Storage directory permissions and missing PHP extensions (`php8.4-xml`)

### Security
- 2FA secrets encrypted with Laravel `encrypt()`/`decrypt()` (AES-256-CBC)
- Recovery codes are single-use and removed after consumption
- Temporary 2FA login tokens expire in 5 minutes and are single-use
- ModSecurity OWASP CRS active with targeted exclusions for auth endpoints

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **OpenVPN Connect page** (`/playground/ovpn`) — HackTheBox-style VPN access page with:
  - Server selection card with region and Free/VIP badge
  - Protocol selector (UDP 1194 / TCP 443)
  - Download button that fetches a personalized `neverland-vpn.ovpn` from the backend
  - Live connection info card (VPN IP, rotation countdown, cipher specs, Refresh button)
  - Quick-start terminal steps (install, connect, verify IP, test gateway)
  - Bottom spec bar: AES-256-GCM · SHA-512 · TLS 1.3 · UDP 1194
- **Custom cursor** — Red glowing ring (`cursor-ring`) with canvas particle trail follows the mouse using lerp animation; all colors updated to match the red brand palette
- **Learning Tools expanded** — 23 fully client-side security tools across 7 categories:
  - Encoding: Base64, URL, Hex↔ASCII, Binary↔Text, HTML Entities
  - Cipher: ROT13, Caesar, Vigenère, Morse, XOR, Atbash
  - Hash: SHA-1/256/384/512, JWT Decoder
  - Security: Password Generator, Password Strength Checker

  - Text: Regex Tester, String Inspector
- Route constant `PLAYGROUND_OVPN = "/playground/ovpn"` added to `constants.ts`
- "Open VPN Connect Page →" shortcut button in the VM terminal's expired-session panel

### Changed
- **VM terminal VPN panel** — Completely redesigned to HTB-style with status cards (DISCONNECTED, Server, Protocol, IP Rotate), full-width download button, and terminal quick-start steps
- **OpenVPN Access card** (bottom of VM page) — Redesigned with header bar, separated spec grid, download button, and connection steps panel
- **Cursor ring and particle trail** — Colors updated from cyan/purple to red (`rgba(239,68,68,...)`) to match site theme
- **VM terminal** — Changed from `overflow-y-auto` (scrollable) to `overflow-hidden` (static, no scroll)
- **README.md** — Complete rewrite: 19 detailed sections, full API reference, project tree, per-feature tables, environment variable guide, troubleshooting with collapsible sections

### Fixed
- **AI Live Chat z-index** — Chat window raised from `z-50` to `z-[60]` to prevent FloatingCartButton from bleeding through the chat overlay
- **Tailwind cursor-pointer override** — `cursor: none !important` placement corrected relative to `@layer` blocks for reliable cursor hiding (later reverted to restore native cursor coexistence)
