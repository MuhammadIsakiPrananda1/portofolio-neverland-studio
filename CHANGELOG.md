## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **OpenVPN Connect page** (`/playground/ovpn`) — HackTheBox-style VPN access page with:
  - Server selection card with region and Free/VIP badge
  - Protocol selector (UDP 1194 / TCP 443)
  - Download button that fetches a personalized `neverland-vpn.ovpn` from the backend
  - Live connection info card (VPN IP, rotation countdown, cipher specs, Refresh button)
  - Quick-start terminal steps (install, connect, verify IP, test gateway)
  - Bottom spec bar: AES-256-GCM · SHA-512 · TLS 1.3 · UDP 1194
- **Custom cursor** — Red glowing ring (`cursor-ring`) with canvas particle trail follows the mouse using lerp animation; all colors updated to match the red brand palette
- **Learning Tools expanded** — 23 fully client-side security tools across 7 categories:
  - Encoding: Base64, URL, Hex↔ASCII, Binary↔Text, HTML Entities
  - Cipher: ROT13, Caesar, Vigenère, Morse, XOR, Atbash
  - Hash: SHA-1/256/384/512, JWT Decoder
  - Security: Password Generator, Password Strength Checker
  - Converter: Base Converter, Timestamp, UUID Generator, Text Case
  - Network: IPv4 Subnet Calculator, Common Ports Reference
  - Text: Regex Tester, String Inspector
- Route constant `PLAYGROUND_OVPN = "/playground/ovpn"` added to `constants.ts`
- "Open VPN Connect Page →" shortcut button in the VM terminal's expired-session panel

### Changed
- **VM terminal VPN panel** — Completely redesigned to HTB-style with status cards (DISCONNECTED, Server, Protocol, IP Rotate), full-width download button, and terminal quick-start steps
- **OpenVPN Access card** (bottom of VM page) — Redesigned with header bar, separated spec grid, download button, and connection steps panel
- **Cursor ring and particle trail** — Colors updated from cyan/purple to red (`rgba(239,68,68,...)`) to match site theme
- **VM terminal** — Changed from `overflow-y-auto` (scrollable) to `overflow-hidden` (static, no scroll)
- **README.md** — Complete rewrite: 19 detailed sections, full API reference, project tree, per-feature tables, environment variable guide, troubleshooting with collapsible sections

### Fixed
- **AI Live Chat z-index** — Chat window raised from `z-50` to `z-[60]` to prevent FloatingCartButton from bleeding through the chat overlay
- **Tailwind cursor-pointer override** — `cursor: none !important` placement corrected relative to `@layer` blocks for reliable cursor hiding (later reverted to restore native cursor coexistence)
